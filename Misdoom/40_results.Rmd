# Results
As figure \@ref(fig:categorization)) shows, we contrasted the results of both groups for each category, (_description_, _conditions_ and _motivations_). As our research question focusses on predictors, only a quick overview will be given for the category _description_.

For the sake of brevity, we will use the following terms: _Hater_ denotes the perpetrator of the hate/ speech, _victim(s)_  the recipient(s) or subject(s) of the hate/ speech, and _adversary victim(s)_ victim(s) or subject(s) of hate/ speech that represent a group the participant politically or personally opposes.

## Description: Experiences with hate/ speech and handling hate/ speech
When describing their experiences with hate/ speech, there are some similarities between both group's _experiences_ with hate/ speech (e.g. the online spaces where they have most often observed it). However, while four of the six _VA_ participants report to have themselves been victims of hate/ speech, only one _MA_ participant does so as well.

Even more notable are the differences in their way of _handling_ the hate/ speech: While participants in group _MA_ tend to look at hateful comments only for entertainment value or avoid looking at comments at all, many participants in group _VA_ actively seek out hateful content in order to fight it. This is of great consequence for our other results.

Only two _MA_ participants report to seldomely engage in counter/ speech at all, much less counter/ speech favoring _adversary victims_. Therefore, the discussion tended to focus on counter/ speech in general and the _conditions_ and _motivations_ listed below were reported in this context. In contrast, all _VA_ participants stated to have engaged in counter/ speech, two of them even in counter/ speech favoring _adversary victims_. Still, with the exception of the subcategory _positive conditions_ the predictors listed are mostly to understand as predictors for counter/ speech in general. 

## Conditions: When to engage in counter/ speech
For a given situation, participants describe both conditions that make it more likely that they engage in counter/ speech ( _positive conditions_) as well as conditions that make it less likely ( _negative conditions_). 

### Positive conditions for counter/ speech favoring adversaries
When it comes defending people who they are politically opposed to, the following conditions emerged in group _VA_: _Offenses against a "culture of discussion"_, i.e., the participant feels that the hater breaks the rules for a respectful debate, _offenses against the human dignity_, i.e., the participant feels that the hater debases the victim's human dignity, different _properties of the victim_, e.g., the participants feels sympathy for the victim, and _a personal connection to the topic discussed_.

### Positive conditions for counter/ speech in general
Concerning the _properties of the hate/ speech_ or the situation where the hate/ speech occurs, participants of both groups mention they are more likely to step in when they feel that their _counter/ speech is likely to have an impact_, e.g. there are not that many comments overall. Additionally, _VA_ participants name the space where the hate/ speech occurs as an important factor. They are more likely to step in when there is hate/ speech _outside of hater-dominated spaces_, e.g., not in a dedicated facebook group, or _in a more private space_, e.g., in a personal chat group. On the other side, _MA_ participants mention _calls to violence and threats_ as well as _doxing_, i.e. finding and disseminating the victim's personal information, as factors making counter/ speech more likely for them.

Relating to the _properties of the victim_, both groups mention that they would be more likely to intervene if _the victim is a private citizen_ or if _they know the victim personally_, although that last condition is more important in group _MA_. Additionaly, participants of the _BA_ group would be more likely to engage in counter/ speech if the _victim is an activist_.

Participants of both groups also mention that their _personal attributes_ influence wether or not they intervene. Members of both groups state that they are more likely to step in if they are _well informed about the topic of discussion_. _VA_ participants_ also name _free time and mental energy_ as a condition. Some members of the _MA_ group, on the other hand, describe 

* _feeling frustrated and angry_ or
* _having a personal connection to the topic of discussion_

as a conductor for counter/ speech.

### Negative conditions for counter/ speech in general
Many of the _negative conditions_ mentioned in the group are merely negations of the _positive conditions_ already listed and will therefore not be reported again.

####  Properties of the hate/ speech
Members of both group state that they are less likely to engage in counter/ speech, when 

* _both sides of the discussion engage in hate/ speech_ or when
* _the hate/ speech is entertaining to them_.

Additionally, participants of the very active group are less willing to intervene when they fear _personal risk to themselves_.

#### Properties of the victim
Apart from the negatives to the _positive conditions_ already mentioned, one member of the very active group reports that they would be less likely to intervene if they suspect _the victim is eager to be seen as a victim by the public_.

## Motivations: Why to engage in counter/ speech
Just as with the conditions, the _motivations_ of the participants could also be categorized into _motivations for intervention_ and _motivations against intervention_. In this context, _motivations_ relate to the participants' attitudes towards counter/ speech in general. By contrast, the _conditions_ listed above relate to specific situations.

### Motivations for intervention
The _motivations for intervention_ can be further categorized into _goals and values_ and _personal attributes and experiences_.

#### Goals and values
Participants of both groups concede that while they might not be able to dissuade the hater from their destructive behavior, they still _hope to positively influence the audience_.
Members of the very active group are additionally motivated by the desire to

* _fight disinformation_,
* _motivate critical thinking in other users_,
* _create a better culture of discussion in online spaces_ and
* _engage politically_.

Moderately active participants, on the other hand, worry that _online hate might spark offline violence_.

#### Personal attributes and experiences
When it comes to their personal attributes and experiences that motivate them to engage in counter/ speech, participants of both groups mention

* _a strong sense of justice_ and
* _a sense of responsibility_.

In addition, very active participants name

* _enjoying debating_,
* _own experiences with bullying and discrimination_, 
* _enjoying self-promotion_, as well as
* _being thanked and admired by others_, e.g. by site administrators,

as motivators.

### Motivations against intervention
Members of both groups name one main motivation not to engage in counter/ speech: They think it is _not worth the effort_. On top of that, members of the very active group mainly mention _fatigue_ with fighting hate/ speech in general as something that demotivates them from engaging in counter/ speech.

Among the moderately active participants, a considerable number more motivations are named:

* _A general unwillingness to participate in online communication_,
* _a preference for alternative approaches to hate/ speech_, e.g. blocking the perpetrator or even reporting them to the police,
* _the chance to be successful is perceived as too small_ and
* _their own tendency to avoid reading comments at all_.
