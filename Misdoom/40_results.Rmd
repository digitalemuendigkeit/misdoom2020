Firstly, a vast difference in engagement levels between the participants was found. While some would not engage in online discourse at all and consequently would not engage in counter speech either, others were hyperactive on social media, placing a lot of value on political discourse in online spaces. Participants in the latter group reported a much higher likelihood to engage in counter speech, be it on behalf of opponents or in general.
The most important antecedents for counter speech found were deep-seated moral convictions as well as a belief that online discourse is an important part of political participation. Participants felt like it was their duties when social justice and truthful arguing were infringed upon. They also hoped to win people over.

Values:

* Human dignity
* Truth (factual, evidence-based)
* Social justice, feminism, anti-racism


(Moral) convictions:

* Online discussions are an important part of the political discourse.
* Therefore participating in online discourse is political activism.
* Online political discourse contributes to people’s opinions therefore I can „win people over“ by arguing my point.
* It is my duty to intervene or speak up when my values are infringed upon.
