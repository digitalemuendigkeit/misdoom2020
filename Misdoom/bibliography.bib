  abstract = {In this study, 378 readers of online hate speech comments were surveyed to examine the motivations of audi- ences for reading the hate speech comments that are published below online news texts. The research's results revealed that respondents were motivated to read them for guidance, entertainment or social utility, convenience, and to seek information. Seeking guidance was the primary motivation for reading online hate speech comments. The respondents' age, level of education, and gender were negatively correlated with all the motivations for read- ing them. Income was not correlated significantly to motivations. Those who conducted a greater amount of online activities read comments for entertainment. Hate speech online comments attracted greater numbers of politically affiliated people.},

  abstract = {The complexity of our global economic, social and political climate has provided a platform for exacerbating tensions between heterogeneous groups, often expressed through increasing levels of hate speech, fostered by intolerance and racism. With the emergence of different social media platforms, such tensions are reflected, and even reinforced, by the large scope and impacts of online media. This is especially the case for young people, often defined as the front runners in the use of digital communication tools. Grounded on an ethnographic multi-sited study, this paper discusses how people experience and react to online hate speech, and argues how a dominating global pattern of normalisation of this phenomenon is expanding, particularly amongst young people.},
