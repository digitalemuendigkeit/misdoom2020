  abstract = {In this study, 378 readers of online hate speech comments were surveyed to examine the motivations of audi- ences for reading the hate speech comments that are published below online news texts. The research's results revealed that respondents were motivated to read them for guidance, entertainment or social utility, convenience, and to seek information. Seeking guidance was the primary motivation for reading online hate speech comments. The respondents' age, level of education, and gender were negatively correlated with all the motivations for read- ing them. Income was not correlated significantly to motivations. Those who conducted a greater amount of online activities read comments for entertainment. Hate speech online comments attracted greater numbers of politically affiliated people.},

  abstract = {This article presents a revised version of GAT, a transcription system first developed by a group of German conversation analysts and interactional linguists in
1998. GAT tries to follow as many principles and conventions as possible of the
Jefferson-style transcription used in Conversation Analysis, yet proposes some
conventions which are more compatible with linguistic and phonetic analyses of
spoken language, especially for the representation of prosody in talk-in-interaction. After ten years of use by researchers in conversation and discourse analysis,
the original GAT has been revised, against the background of past experience and
in light of new necessities for the transcription of corpora arising from technological advances and methodological developments over recent years. The present
text makes GAT accessible for the English-speaking community. It presents the
GAT 2 transcription system with all its conventions and gives detailed instructions on how to transcribe spoken interaction at three levels of delicacy: minimal,
basic and fine. In addition, it briefly introduces some tools that may be helpful for
the user: the German online tutorial GAT-TO and the transcription editing
software FOLKER.},

  abstract = {The complexity of our global economic, social and political climate has provided a platform for exacerbating tensions between heterogeneous groups, often expressed through increasing levels of hate speech, fostered by intolerance and racism. With the emergence of different social media platforms, such tensions are reflected, and even reinforced, by the large scope and impacts of online media. This is especially the case for young people, often defined as the front runners in the use of digital communication tools. Grounded on an ethnographic multi-sited study, this paper discusses how people experience and react to online hate speech, and argues how a dominating global pattern of normalisation of this phenomenon is expanding, particularly amongst young people.},
